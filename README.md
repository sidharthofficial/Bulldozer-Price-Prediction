# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction
Tried to predict price of bulldozers

Project on structured data.
In this project I have tried to predict the auction value of bulldozers based on many parameters using a jupyter notebook.
The data and the project were taken from a kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview
The data was first cleansed and the train and valid datasets split.
The evaluation was based on rrot mean squared log error(RMSLE).
The dataset was then trained on a RandomForestRegressor model and final score was prodeced alomg with the feature importances plotted.
